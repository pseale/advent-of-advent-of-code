add scaffolding - i.e. get a walking skeleton going

parse out input
 - drawn numbers
 - bingo boards

loop:
 - draw a number
 - apply to boards
 - check if WE HAVE A WINNER - exit loop if so

Advent of Code "trim answer down to a single non-guessable number":
 - multiply final drawn number * (sum of all UNMARKED numbers on the board)



TWO PROBLEMS WITH "TDD-DRIVING" ADVENT OF CODE:
1. TDD Sudoku Solver experiment proved TDD is not good for math/algorithms
2. ADVENT OF CODE PROBLEMS ARE SO ARTIFICIAL - single-number outputs are UNREALISTIC
