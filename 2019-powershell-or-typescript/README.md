# Advent of Code 2019

Advent of Code 2020 is imminent! Prepare ye the way!

## Goals

- [✔]To stream, as early as January 2020.
- [❌❌❌❌🟡]To familiarize myself with .NET 5.
- [✔✔✔🟡🟡]During this special time of Advent, in which we celebrate the coming of Advent of Code 2020, in the spirit of reverence and fastidious self-contemplation, solve as many as five (5) Advent of Code 2018 challenges.
  - [✔]Clarifying rule: I may choose any of the 2018 problems, and I may choose to solve one or both stars. It's not my fault if I declare vendetta against some of the more frustrating "fun puzzles".
  - [✔✔❌✔🟡]Do something different!
  - [✔✔✔✔✔]Code golf is garbage (❌⛳❌). Let's not do code golf.

## Reflecting on estimation

Nobody is good at estimation. Even me, superman. I've logged my estimates that prove Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.

- Day 01 (cheating)
  - Estimate: 5 minutes
  - Actual: 30 minutes
  - Unexpected landmine: cheating is harder than it seems. You have to work surprisingly hard to cheat, because code samples don't run without some tweaking!
  - Expected landmine, but I stepped on it anyway: why did I believe I could possibly get a naked TypeScript code snippet compiling in less than 17 hours? I wasted a few minutes trying.
- Day 02 (hacking in PowerShell)
  - Estimate: 60 minutes
  - Actual: 85 minutes
  - Unexpected landmine: didn't understand part A problem until I had solved the problem wrong 2x-3x
- Day 05 (cheating)
  - Estimate: 10 minutes
  - Actual: 4 minutes
- Day 03 (heavy visualization)
  - Estimate: 1 hour?
  - Actual: 4 hours and counting
  - Unexpected landmine: honestly, I had no idea what I was even going to build. So 🤷‍♀️.
  - Unexpected landmine: major bug with part A solution (the bug having nothing to do with visualization)
