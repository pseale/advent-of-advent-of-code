# Slow-cooked Advent of Code 2020

Welcome!

## Goals

We're here to:

- Solve _some of_ Advent of Code 2020
  - Goal: 10 stars
- Slow cook the development process
  - Break down the problem into tiny bits, and validate every assumption
  - Use the REPL, tests, debuggers, browser tools, test harnesses
  - Rad data visualizations in p5.js
- Learn JavaScript, almost by accident
  - This mostly means don't install lodash immediately, even though I **really** want to.

## Stretch goals

- Publish data visualizations in the form of either video, twitter-consumable gif, or a sweet png
- Match the greatness found at https://codepen.io/anon/pen/bBOZXO (from my 2016 solutions)

## Non-goals

- Non-goal: learn about math or algorithms
  - this means I permit myself to cheat
- Non-goal: 50 stars (i.e., allow myself to finish only some of the problems)
- Non-goal: Jupyter notebooks (or similar). They seem useful ... later
- Non-goal: Code golf. Code golf is code garbage
- Non-goal: Solving problems quickly. I'm slow anyway, and will get stuck
- Non-goal: Execution speed or efficiency, within reason\*
- Non-goal: Master the nutty JavaScript ecosystem. Y'all crazy, you know that. E.g. I just tried to get jest working with ES6-style import/exports, and lost 60 minutes of my life. I'll never get that time back
